# Algorithms
Other than just building apps I love testing myself solving algorithm problems. I have completed a couple of coursera courses on algorithms using Python. These ranged from sorting and searching algorithms to advanced graph and dynamic programming algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, minimum spanning trees, and weighted independent sets in path graphs. I have done plenty of problems on codewars in JavaScript which is website that has problems ranging from easy (8 kyu) to very hard (1 kyu). I am proud to say that I am in the 98th percentile on codewars and have done problems in the 2kyu - 4kyu range. Please feel free to take a look through my implementation of these algorithms.
